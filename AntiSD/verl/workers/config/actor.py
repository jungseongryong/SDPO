@dataclass
class CCIRConfig(BaseConfig):
    """Configuration for CCIR (Contrastive Causal Information Reward).

    When enabled, provides contrastive causal information reward (CCIR).
    In "sdpo" mode with full_logit_distillation + distillation_topk, computes distributional
    S_t(v) = log π_t(v|x,z) - log π_t(v|x',z) over topk vocab items and weights the
    per-vocab KL loss by (1 + prm_weight * S_t(v)).
    In "sdpo" mode without topk, falls back to per-token scalar S_t additive PG term.
    In "grpo_ccir" mode, combines GRPO policy gradient with CCIR-weighted topk KL distillation:
        L = L_GRPO(A_seq) + kl_coeff · L_CCIR_KL(S_t_topk)
    where L_CCIR_KL is computed by compute_self_distillation_loss with distributional CCIR weighting.
    In "grpo_st" mode, uses S_t to refine GRPO per-token advantages (no vocab-level KL):
        A_refined(t) = A_seq * (1 + st_advantage_alpha * S_t_norm(t))   when A_seq != 0
        A_refined(t) = st_fallback_beta * S_t_norm(t)                    when A_seq == 0
    In "grpo_ca" mode (credit assignment), fuses SDPO's full PRM signal with GRPO advantage:
        PRM_t = (s - t) - prm_weight * (t - c)    [full SDPO advantage]
        ca_mode="additive":       A_refined(t) = orm_weight * A_seq + ca_lambda * normalize(PRM_t)
        ca_mode="multiplicative": A_refined(t) = A_seq * (1 + ca_lambda * normalize(PRM_t))
        ca_mode="rlsd":           A_refined(t) = A_seq * ((1-λ) + λ * clip(exp(sign(A)*(t-s)), 1-ε, 1+ε))
    Multiplicative mode constrains PRM to only modulate ORM's direction (prevents length explosion).
    Additive mode allows PRM to create independent optimization direction.
    RLSD mode (Yang 2026) is magnitude-only: direction is always sign(A_seq) from environment reward;
    the evidence ratio (P_T/P_S)^{sign(A)} only modulates magnitude. Used as Prop 3 ablation.

    Args:
        enabled: Whether to enable CCIR contrastive weighting.
        num_contrastive: Number of prompt shuffles (K). K=1 is most efficient.
        temperature: DEPRECATED. Was used for sigmoid weighting in earlier CCIR versions. Kept for config compatibility.
        min_weight: DEPRECATED. Was used as minimum CCIR weight floor. Kept for config compatibility.
        prm_weight: Weight λ for CCIR S_t within self-distillation.
            In sdpo distributional mode: KL weight = 1 + λ·S_t(v). λ=0 gives uniform (unweighted) KL.
            In grpo_ca mode: PRM_t = (s - t) - λ·(t - c). λ=0 gives pure KL gap (no CCIR).
        kl_coeff: Coefficient γ controlling KL regularization strength relative to GRPO.
            L = L_GRPO + γ·L_CCIR_KL. γ=0 recovers pure GRPO.
        st_advantage_alpha: Multiplicative S_t modulation coefficient for grpo_st mode.
            Controls how much S_t redistributes credit within a sequence when outcome signal exists.
        st_fallback_beta: Additive S_t coefficient for grpo_st mode when all rollouts fail (A_seq=0).
            Provides dense gradient signal from S_t when GRPO advantage is zero.
        ca_lambda: PRM → ORM injection strength for grpo_ca mode.
            A_t = orm_weight * A_seq + ca_lambda * normalize(PRM_t). Controls how much the full
            token-level PRM signal modulates the sequence-level GRPO advantage.
        orm_weight: Weight on GRPO's sequence-level advantage in grpo_ca mode.
            A_t = orm_weight * A_seq + ca_lambda * normalize(PRM_t).
            orm_weight=1 (default): standard GRPO + PRM.
            orm_weight=0: pure PRM signal, no outcome reward.
        prm_normalize: Whether to normalize PRM_t to zero-mean unit-variance (grpo_ca mode).
            True: PRM_norm = (PRM_t - mean) / std. Signal magnitude is constant regardless of
            student-teacher gap. Risks amplifying noise as model converges.
            False: use raw PRM_t. Signal naturally decays as student approaches teacher.
            NOTE: This is the legacy per-batch normalization. For per-sequence normalization,
            use prm_normalize_mode="sequence" instead (which supersedes this flag).
        prm_normalize_mode: PRM normalization granularity (grpo_ca mode).
            "batch": Per-batch zero-mean unit-variance (same as prm_normalize=True). All sequences
                share the same mean/std. Length-dependent PRM bias is NOT removed.
            "sequence": Per-sequence zero-mean unit-variance. Each sequence's PRM is independently
                standardized. Removes both first-moment (mean) and second-moment (variance)
                length dependence. PRM becomes a pure credit assignment weight: mean=0, var=1
                per sequence regardless of response length or hint quality.
                Supersedes prm_normalize and prm_seq_demean when set.
            "none": No normalization. Raw PRM_t = (s-t) - w*(t-c).
        prm_clip: Truncation magnitude for PRM signal (grpo_ca mode).
            When set, clamps PRM (after optional normalization) to [-prm_clip, prm_clip].
            Prevents extreme PRM values from dominating. null disables clipping.
        prm_anchor_to_orm: Whether to rescale PRM signal to match ORM signal magnitude (grpo_ca mode).
            When True, PRM is multiplied by |orm_term|_mean / |prm_term|_mean so that
            ca_lambda controls the true ORM:PRM ratio regardless of advantage collapse.
            Prevents PRM from dominating when A_seq shrinks during training.
        prm_seq_demean: Whether to remove per-sequence mean from PRM signal (grpo_ca mode).
            When True, PRM_t is replaced by PRM_t - mean_t(PRM_t) per sequence, so PRM only
            does within-sequence credit redistribution (which tokens matter more/less) without
            adding a net positive/negative bias per sequence. ORM controls the overall direction
            (reinforce/suppress), PRM controls intra-sequence token credit assignment.
            NOTE: prm_normalize_mode="sequence" supersedes this (it does demean + variance norm).
        ca_mode: Advantage composition mode for grpo_ca.
            "additive": A_t = orm_weight * A_seq + ca_lambda * PRM_processed.
                PRM creates an independent optimization direction. Prone to length explosion.
            "multiplicative": A_t = A_seq * (1 + ca_lambda * PRM_processed).
                PRM only modulates ORM's direction; cannot create independent signal.
                When A_seq=0 (uniform group), A_t=0 — PRM cannot override ORM.
                Prevents length explosion by construction.
        prm_entropy_neutral: Entropy-neutral PRM decorrelation mode (grpo_ca mode).
            PRM_t = s_t - t_t is correlated with student confidence s_t = log π(y_t).
            This correlation causes PRM to act as "policy momentum" — systematically
            reinforcing confident tokens — leading to entropy collapse.

            Decorrelation removes the component of PRM linearly correlated with s_t:
                PRM_EN = PRM - β·(s - mean(s)),  β = Cov(PRM, s) / Var(s)
            By construction Cov(PRM_EN, s) = 0, so the first-order entropy effect vanishes.

            Options:
            "none": No decorrelation. Original PRM_t = s_t - t_t.
            "decorrelate": Full decorrelation. Remove the s_t-correlated component from PRM.
                β = 1 - Cov(s,t)/Var(s) is computed per sequence and adapts automatically:
                β ≈ 0 early (teacher ≈ student) → full PRM speed;
                β grows as teacher lags → momentum suppressed.
        ca_beta: DEPRECATED. CCIR debiasing is now hardcoded as β=1 in grpo_ca.
            The inner CCIR weight is controlled by prm_weight instead.
